            <h2 class="heading">Objective</h2>
            <p class="text">TThe objective of this project is to create an informative and visually engaging data visualization centered around COVID-19 risk factors, providing insights into the virusâ€™s impact on certain health related factors.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="text">The COVID-19 data visualization project will present a comprehensive overview of key statistics, trends, and patterns related to certain health factors. It will utilize various visualization techniques to effectively communicate complex data in an accessible and understandable format. </p>
            <h2 class="heading">Key Features:</h2>
            <ul >
                <li class="text2">Comparative Analysis: Enable users to compare COVID-19 statistics between countries or regions to identify disparities and trends.</li>
                <li class="text2">Predictive Modeling: Integrate predictive models to forecast future COVID-19 cases in relation to certain health factors and assess the potential impact of interventions.</li>
                <li class="text2">Vulnerable Populations Analysis: Identify and visualize populations at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as older adults and individuals with pre-existing conditions. </li>
                <li class="text2">Public Policy Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as lockdowns, mask mandates, and social distancing policies, through visualization of infection rates and policy implementation timelines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="heading">Target Audience</h2>
            <p class="text">The target audience for the COVID-19 data visualization project includes policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, students, and the general public interested in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and making informed decisions.
